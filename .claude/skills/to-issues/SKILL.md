# To Issues

Break a plan into independently-grabbable issues using vertical slices (tracer bullets).

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you — run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if not.

## Presenting decisions to the human

Every place below where the human is asked to decide, approve, or confirm
something must do three things. The goal is not to dumb the information
down — it's to make it as easy as possible to read, understand, and decide
on:

1. **Full context first.** State what's being decided and why it matters, in
   one message. Don't make the human scroll back through the conversation to
   piece it together.
2. **Plain words — teachable, not dumbed down.** 8th/9th-grade English. If a
   technical term really is the clearest word, say the plain-English effect
   *before* using the term — never name a mechanism and assume it's
   understood (see `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → "Communication voice"). The bar:
   could the human explain this back to a colleague and answer a follow-up
   question about it, confidently? If not, simplify the language further —
   never cut real information to get there.
3. **Leave the door open.** Close with something like "ask me to explain any
   part of this before you decide." A summary the human can't question is a
   rubber stamp, not a decision.

**Choosing how to ask.** For a small set of discrete choices — approve
vs. reject, pick one of a few options — use `AskUserQuestion`; it renders as
clickable options and already has a built-in escape hatch (the human can
always answer "Other" with free text instead of picking a preset). For
anything the human needs to actually read before deciding — the full issue
breakdown, the granularity mapping, a full report — present it as prose or a
document; a structured question can't hold that much content.

This applies to Step 4 ("Quiz the user") — the breakdown, granularity, and
HITL/AFK split the human is asked to approve before any issue gets published.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes an issue reference (issue number, URL, or path) as an argument, fetch it from the issue tracker and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Issue titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' or 'AFK'. HITL slices require human interaction, such as an architectural decision or a design review. AFK slices can be implemented and merged without human interaction. Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses (if the source material has them)

The first time you use HITL or AFK, spell out what they mean in plain
words: HITL means "needs a human to review or decide something before it
can move forward"; AFK means "an agent can build and merge this without
anyone checking in." Invite the user to ask about any slice before they
approve the breakdown.

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?
- Are the correct slices marked as HITL and AFK?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### Publish gate — requires an explicit, same-turn instruction

Steps 1–4 (gather context, explore, draft, quiz) may run without the user typing `/to-issues`
themselves — an agent may invoke this skill on its own initiative as part of a larger workflow.
**Step 5 is different: it is a hard stop.** Publishing writes real, hard-to-reverse tickets to
an external tracker. Do not proceed to Step 5 unless the user's own words in the current turn
say to publish (e.g. "publish it," "yes, create the issues," "go ahead" in direct response to
the Step 4 breakdown). Approving the breakdown's *granularity* in Step 4 is not the same as
authorizing publish — ask for publish confirmation as its own, separate step even when Step 4's
approval was enthusiastic. If the user approved the breakdown in one turn and the publish
instruction hasn't come yet, stop and wait — do not assume silence or a later unrelated message
means go-ahead.

### 5. Publish the issues to the issue tracker

For each approved slice, publish a new issue to the issue tracker. Use the issue body template below. These issues are considered ready for AFK agents, so publish them with the correct triage label unless instructed otherwise.

Publish issues in dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real issue identifiers in the "Blocked by" field.

<issue-template>
## Parent

A reference to the parent issue on the issue tracker (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit this section).

## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

Avoid specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it here and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Blocked by

- A reference to the blocking ticket (if any)

Or "None - can start immediately" if no blockers.

</issue-template>

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.
